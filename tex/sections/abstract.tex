    \begin{itemize}
    	\item Most works in algorithmic recourse/strategic classification assume a simple, pre-specified cost function for changing feature values.
    	\item Understanding \textit{individual} cost functions is important for generating recourse and understanding \textit{global} cost functions is important for strategic classification.
    	\item Whilst there has been research into generating individual recourse through preference elicitation, there has not been research into learning \textit{global} cost functions.
    	\item Learning algorithms are proposed to learn cost function from the users' revealed preferences - their responses to a series of pairwise comparisons of different recourse options.
    	\item The algorithms are evaluated on synthetic and semi-synthetic data.
    	\item Recourse costs are compared for users with different protected attributes, showing if learning costs functions aids or exacerbates fairness of recourse.
    \end{itemize}
